## 10/19/2025 - Platform Research  

I spent an hour figuring out the best platform for creating schematic diagram and PCB. i first tried tinkercad but it didn't had Arduino Nano, then I used wokwi and it didn't had IR Sensor. Now I am deciding whether to use KiCad for schematic diagram or just make a handdrawn schematic diagram. I also visited Altium and Proteus for PCB Design and visited JLCPCB website for having an idea PCB manufacturing. I have now decided to first test the robot by making it on breadboard and then shifting to PCB once it works on breadboard.
