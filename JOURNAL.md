## 10/19/2025 - Platform Research  

I spent an hour figuring out the best platform for creating schematic diagram and PCB. i first tried tinkercad but it didn't had Arduino Nano, then I used wokwi and it didn't had IR Sensor. Now I am deciding whether to use KiCad for schematic diagram or just make a handdrawn schematic diagram. I also visited Altium and Proteus for PCB Design and visited JLCPCB website for having an idea PCB manufacturing. I have now decided to first test the robot by making it on breadboard and then shifting to PCB once it works on breadboard.

## 10/23/2025 - Started making BoM  

I spent about 30 Minutes doing research on all the components required for my robot. Then I started choosing the specifications of each componenet that will work best. Then I listed them all in an excel sheet in attempt to create a BoM. Then I did research about the vendors from whom I can get these componenets. There were some like Digilog but they didnt accepted Visa Payment so finally I had to choose AliExpress. Now I am adding all the components to cart on AliExpress and will soon complete the BoM. I hope the next journal will be about completion of BoM and Readme file.

## 10/28/2025 - Solved a stupid issue  

Its something unrealistic to say but I spend 1.5 hours just figuring out which Buck Convertors to use between battery, ESP32 and Motor Driver. Sometimes I found the efficiency to be not suitable and sometimes current, heat, voltage etc. But at the last I have chose 2 different Buck Convertors well suited for their purpose. I also deleted whole BoM and created it once again. Moreover, I tried creating schematic diagram of circuit on KiCad but failed :(. I will do it once BoM is complete.![Screenshot (4)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--324c50989046fa0e1a2a4eb0a94a61a335044364/Screenshot%20(4).png)
